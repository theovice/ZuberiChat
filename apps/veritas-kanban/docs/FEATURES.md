## Board & Task Management

The Kanban board is the central interface — a drag-and-drop workspace that reflects your project's state in real time.

![Board overview](../assets/demo-overview.gif)

---

## PRD-Driven Autonomous Development

Transform product requirements into working code through iterative, quality-gated autonomous execution. An AI agent reads a PRD, breaks it into implementable user stories, autonomously codes each story with quality gates, and iterates until complete—memory preserved through git history and progress files.

**Key capabilities:**

- **Quality-gated execution** — reviewGate (4×10 scoring), closingComments, autoTelemetry ensure deterministic checks
- **Fresh context per iteration** — Each story runs in clean context; no window bloat
- **Compound learning** — Progress files capture lessons; later iterations benefit from earlier ones
- **Real-time monitoring** — Squad Chat provides step-by-step narrative of agent progress
- **Full audit trail** — Git commits + telemetry + time tracking = complete execution record
- **Parallel execution** — Multiple agents can work on different features simultaneously

**Quick start:** Create PRD template with user stories as subtasks → `vk automation:start <task-id>` → monitor Squad Chat → review and merge

**Use when:** Clear requirements, independent stories, measurable quality (tests/linters), small iterations (≤30 min/story), reproducible execution

**Avoid for:** Vague requirements, exploratory work, complex architectural decisions, high-risk changes (migrations, auth), research tasks

## Crash-Recovery Checkpointing (v3.3.0)

Save and resume agent state across crashes and restarts with automatic secret sanitization.

- **Save/resume/clear API** — `POST /api/tasks/:id/checkpoint` (save), `GET /api/tasks/:id/checkpoint` (resume), `DELETE /api/tasks/:id/checkpoint` (clear)
- **Auto-sanitization of secrets** — Detects and sanitizes 20+ key patterns (API keys, tokens, passwords, etc.) plus regex value detection
- **1MB size limit** — Prevents checkpoint bloat; server rejects payloads exceeding 1MB
- **24h expiry** — Automatic cleanup of stale checkpoints after 24 hours
- **Resume counter** — Tracks restart attempts to prevent infinite loops
- **Sub-agent context injection** — Checkpoint state automatically injected into sub-agent prompts on resume
- **Array sanitization** — Handles nested objects and primitive strings within arrays
- **NaN timestamp handling** — Converts NaN timestamps to null for proper serialization
- **ARIA-accessible UI** — Checkpoint controls in TaskCard and TaskDetailPanel with full keyboard navigation

**Use cases:**

- Agent crashes mid-execution → resume from last checkpoint
- Server restart during long-running task → restore agent context
- Iterative workflows → preserve state between steps

**Example:**

```bash
# Save checkpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/tasks/US-42/checkpoint \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"state":{"current_step":3,"completed":["step1","step2"],"api_key":"sk-1234"}}'

# Resume checkpoint (secrets sanitized in response)
curl http://localhost:3001/api/tasks/US-42/checkpoint
# Returns: {"state":{"current_step":3,"completed":["step1","step2"],"api_key":"[REDACTED]"},...}

# Clear checkpoint
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3001/api/tasks/US-42/checkpoint
```

## Observational Memory (v3.3.0)

Capture and search critical insights, decisions, blockers, and context across agent workflows.

- **Add/view/delete observations** — `POST /api/observations`, `GET /api/tasks/:id/observations`, `DELETE /api/observations/:id`
- **Four observation types** — decision, blocker, insight, context with color-coded badges
- **Importance scoring** — Rate observations 1-10 with visual badges (1-3: low, 4-7: medium, 8-10: high)
- **Full-text search** — `GET /api/observations/search?query=...` searches across all observations for all tasks
- **Paginated results** — Search supports limit/offset with max 200 results per page
- **Timeline view** — Chronological display with type-colored badges and importance indicators
- **Activity logging** — All observation changes logged to activity feed for audit trail
- **XSS prevention** — `sanitizeCommentText()` strips script tags and dangerous attributes
- **ARIA-accessible UI** — Range slider for importance, decorative icons properly labeled

**Use cases:**

- Agent makes architectural decision → log as "decision" observation
- Blocked by external dependency → log as "blocker" observation
- Learns better approach → log as "insight" observation
- Needs context for future work → log as "context" observation

**Example:**

```bash
# Add observation
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/observations \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"taskId":"US-42","type":"decision","content":"Chose React Query over Redux for simpler data fetching","importance":8}'

# Search across all tasks
curl "http://localhost:3001/api/observations/search?query=react+query&limit=10"

# Get observations for task
curl http://localhost:3001/api/tasks/US-42/observations
```

---

## Agent Filter (v3.3.0)

Query tasks by agent name for precise agent workload tracking.

- **Query parameter** — `GET /api/tasks?agent=name` filters tasks assigned to specific agent
- **Input sanitization** — Agent name trimmed and capped at 100 characters
- **Pagination compatible** — Works with existing `limit`, `offset`, `status` filters
- **JSDoc/OpenAPI documented** — Full API documentation in server code

**Use cases:**

- Check what tasks are assigned to "codex" → `GET /api/tasks?agent=codex`
- Find all "veritas" tasks in "blocked" status → `GET /api/tasks?agent=veritas&status=blocked`
- Agent workload reporting → query by agent name for analytics

**Example:**

```bash
# Get all tasks for agent "codex"
curl "http://localhost:3001/api/tasks?agent=codex"

# Get blocked tasks for agent "veritas"
curl "http://localhost:3001/api/tasks?agent=veritas&status=blocked"

# Paginated results
curl "http://localhost:3001/api/tasks?agent=codex&limit=25&offset=0"
```

## Efficient Polling (v2.0.0)

Optimized change-detection endpoint for agents that poll instead of using WebSocket.

- **Change feed** — `GET /api/changes?since=<ISO timestamp>` returns only tasks modified after the given timestamp
- **ETag support** — Responses include `ETag` headers; clients send `If-None-Match` to receive `304 Not Modified` when nothing changed
- **Minimal payload** — Returns only changed task IDs and their new status, reducing bandwidth
- **Agent-friendly** — Designed for headless agents that cannot maintain WebSocket connections
- **Complements WebSocket** — Use WebSocket for real-time UI updates; use `/api/changes` for lightweight agent polling

### API Endpoints

| Endpoint                   | Method | Description                                    |
| -------------------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `/api/changes?since=<ISO>` | GET    | Get tasks changed since timestamp (ETag aware) |

- **Scoped delegation** — Restrict delegation to specific projects, task types, or priority levels
- **Automatic routing** — Approval requests automatically routed to the delegate when the primary approver is unavailable
- **Vacation mode** — Mark yourself as unavailable; all approvals reroute to your configured delegate
- **Audit trail** — All delegated approvals logged with both original approver and delegate for accountability

---

## Reverse Proxy Ready (v2.1.1)

Deploy Veritas Kanban behind nginx, Caddy, Traefik, or any reverse proxy.

- **`TRUST_PROXY` environment variable** — Set to `true`, `1`, or a comma-separated list of trusted proxy IPs/CIDRs
- **Correct client IP resolution** — With `TRUST_PROXY` enabled, Express reads the real client IP from `X-Forwarded-For` headers
- **Secure cookies** — When behind a TLS-terminating proxy, session cookies respect `X-Forwarded-Proto`
- **Rate limiting accuracy** — Rate limits apply to the real client IP, not the proxy's IP
- **WebSocket passthrough** — WebSocket connections work through reverse proxies with standard `Upgrade` header forwarding

### Example Configurations

**nginx:**

```nginx
location / {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:3001;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
}
```

**Environment:**

```bash
TRUST_PROXY=true
```

## Workflow Engine (v3.0.0)

A deterministic multi-step agent orchestration system for repeatable, observable, and reliable agent execution. Think GitHub Actions for AI agents.

### Overview

The workflow engine transforms Veritas Kanban from an ad-hoc task board into a full-featured agent orchestration platform. Define multi-step pipelines as version-controlled YAML files, execute them with loops, gates, and parallel steps, and monitor everything in real time through the dashboard.

**What it does:**

- Coordinates multiple agents across sequential or parallel steps
- Manages state persistence, retries, and human escalation
- Provides real-time visibility into workflow execution
- Enforces tool policies and session isolation for security

**What it is NOT:**

- Not a general-purpose workflow engine (Temporal, Airflow) — optimized for AI agents
- Not a replacement for OpenClaw — workflows invoke OpenClaw sessions
- Not a programming language — declarative YAML, not imperative scripts

### Core Principles

1. **Deterministic Execution** — Same workflow + same inputs = same execution path (modulo agent non-determinism)
2. **Agent-Agnostic** — Workflows don't care which LLM/agent runs steps (OpenClaw handles that)
3. **YAML-First** — Workflows are version-controlled YAML files, not database records
4. **Observable** — Every step logs outputs, status broadcasts via WebSocket
5. **Fail-Safe** — Explicit retry/escalation policies, no silent failures
6. **Fresh Context by Default** — Each step spawns a fresh OpenClaw session (prevents context bleed)

### Workflow Definitions

Workflows are defined as YAML files stored in `.veritas-kanban/workflows/`:

```yaml
id: feature-dev-simple
name: Feature Development Workflow
version: 1
description: |
  Plan → Implement → Verify pipeline for feature development.

config:
  timeout: 7200 # Max workflow duration (seconds)
  fresh_session_default: true
  progress_file: progress.md
  telemetry_tags: ['workflow', 'feature-dev']

agents:
  - id: planner
    name: Planner
    role: analysis # Maps to tool policy
    model: github-copilot/claude-opus-4.6
    description: Task decomposition specialist

  - id: developer
    name: Developer
    role: coding
    model: github-copilot/claude-sonnet-4.5
    description: Feature implementation

steps:
  - id: plan
    name: 'Plan: Decompose task'
    agent: planner
    type: agent
    fresh_session: true
    input: |
      Decompose this task into implementable stories.

      TASK: {{task.title}}
      {{task.description}}

      Output YAML:
      stories:
        - id: story-1
          title: ...
    output:
      file: plan.yml
    acceptance_criteria:
      - 'Output contains valid YAML'
      - 'At least 3 stories defined'
    on_fail:
      retry: 2
      escalate_to: human
    timeout: 600

  - id: implement
    name: 'Implement: Code stories'
    agent: developer
    type: agent
    input: |
      Implement these stories:
      {{plan.output}}
    output:
      file: implementation.md
    on_fail:
      retry: 1
```

### Step Types

#### 1. Agent Steps

Execute a single agent prompt with configurable retries.

**Configuration:**

```yaml
- id: review
  name: 'Review: Code quality check'
  agent: reviewer
  type: agent
  session:
    mode: fresh # fresh | reuse
    context: minimal # minimal | full | custom
    cleanup: delete # delete | keep
    timeout: 300 # seconds
  input: |
    Review this code:
    {{implement.output}}
  output:
    file: review.md
  acceptance_criteria:
    - 'DECISION: approved'
  on_fail:
    retry: 2
    escalate_to: human
```

**Features:**

- Template rendering with `{{variable}}` and `{{nested.path}}` substitution
- Acceptance criteria validation (substring, regex, JSON path)
- Retry routing: retry same step, retry different step, escalate

#### 2. Loop Steps (#112)

Iterate over collections with progress tracking.

**Configuration:**

```yaml
- id: process-stories
  name: 'Process: Implement stories'
  type: loop
  agent: developer
  loop:
    over: '{{plan.stories}}' # Expression returning array
    item_var: story # Variable name for current item
    index_var: index # Loop index variable
    completion: all_done # all_done | any_done | first_success
    fresh_session_per_iteration: true # Spawn new session per iteration
    max_iterations: 20 # Safety limit
    continue_on_error: false # Skip failed iterations
  input: |
    Implement story {{loop.index + 1}}/{{loop.total}}:

    STORY: {{story.title}}
    {{story.description}}

    COMPLETED: {{loop.completed | join(", ")}}
  output:
    file: 'implement-{{loop.index}}.md'
```

**Features:**

- Loop state tracking: `totalIterations`, `currentIteration`, `completedIterations`, `failedIterations`
- Completion policies:
  - `all_done` — All iterations must complete successfully
  - `any_done` — Stop after first successful iteration
  - `first_success` — Stop immediately when one succeeds
- Loop variables in templates: `{{loop.index}}`, `{{loop.total}}`, `{{loop.completed}}`
- Max 1000 iterations safety limit

#### 3. Gate Steps

Conditional blocking with human approval workflow.

**Configuration:**

```yaml
- id: quality-gate
  name: 'Gate: Quality Check'
  type: gate
  condition: '{{test.status == "passed" and verify.decision == "approved"}}'
  on_false:
    escalate_to: human
    escalate_message: 'Quality gate failed — manual review required'
```

**Features:**

- Boolean expressions: `==`, `and`, `or` operators with variable access
- Blocking behavior: run status changes to `blocked` if condition fails
- Approval API: `POST /api/workflow-runs/:runId/steps/:stepId/approve` and `/reject`
- Timeout support (planned)

#### 4. Parallel Steps

Fan-out/fan-in execution with multiple sub-steps running concurrently.

**Configuration:**

```yaml
- id: parallel-tests
  name: 'Parallel: Run test suites'
  type: parallel
  parallel:
    completion: all # all | any | N (number)
    fail_fast: true # Abort others when one fails
    timeout: 1800 # Max wait time (seconds)
    steps:
      - id: unit-tests
        agent: tester
        input: 'Run unit tests'
      - id: integration-tests
        agent: tester
        input: 'Run integration tests'
      - id: e2e-tests
        agent: tester
        input: 'Run E2E tests'
```

**Features:**

- Completion criteria:
  - `all` — All sub-steps must succeed
  - `any` — At least one sub-step must succeed
  - `N` — At least N sub-steps must succeed
- Fail-fast mode aborts remaining sub-steps on first failure
- Aggregated JSON output with per-sub-step status and errors
- Max 50 concurrent sub-steps (soft limit)

### Run State Management

Every workflow run persists its state to disk, enabling:

- **Server restart recovery** — Runs can resume from last checkpoint
- **Retry with exponential backoff** — Configurable `retry_delay_ms` prevents rapid retry loops
- **Progress file tracking** — Shared `progress.md` per run for context passing:
  - Each step appends its output with timestamp
  - Templates can access `{{progress}}` for previous step context
  - Templates can access `{{steps.step-id.output}}` for specific step outputs
- **Session tracking** — Session keys stored in `run.context._sessions` per agent

**Run lifecycle:**

```
pending → running → completed
                 ↘ failed
                 ↘ blocked (gate failure, escalation)
```

### Tool Policies (#110)

Role-based tool restrictions for least-privilege security.

**Default roles:**

| Role        | Allowed Tools                                            | Denied Tools               | Use Case                                        |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `planner`   | Read, web_search, web_fetch, browser, image, nodes       | Write, Edit, exec, message | Analysis and planning — read-only access        |
| `developer` | `*` (all tools)                                          | none                       | Feature implementation — full access            |
| `reviewer`  | Read, exec, web_search, web_fetch, browser, image, nodes | Write, Edit, message       | Code review — can run tests but not modify code |
| `tester`    | Read, exec, browser, web_search, web_fetch, image, nodes | Write, Edit, message       | Testing — can interact with UIs and run tests   |
| `deployer`  | `*` (all tools)                                          | none                       | Deployment operations — full access             |

**Custom policies:**

- Create custom roles via `POST /api/tool-policies`
- Edit existing policies via `PUT /api/tool-policies/:role`
- Delete custom policies (default roles are immutable)
- Settings UI tab for visual management

**Enforcement:**

- Tool filter passed to OpenClaw `sessions_spawn` (ready for integration)
- Denied list takes precedence over allowed list

### Session Management (#111)

Each workflow step can run in an isolated OpenClaw session.

**Session configuration:**

```yaml
session:
  mode: fresh # fresh | reuse
  context: minimal # minimal | full | custom
  cleanup: delete # delete | keep
  timeout: 300 # seconds
  includeOutputsFrom: [step-1, step-2] # for context: custom
```

**Session modes:**

- **`fresh`** (default) — Spawn a new session for each step
  - Prevents context window bloat
  - Isolates steps from each other
  - Enables agent specialization

- **`reuse`** — Continue the existing session for this agent
  - Preserves conversation history
  - Useful for multi-turn interactions

**Context injection modes:**

- **`minimal`** — Only task metadata and workflow context
  - Smallest context window
  - Best for independent steps

- **`full`** — All previous step outputs + workflow variables
  - Maximum context
  - Useful for steps that need comprehensive history

- **`custom`** — Explicitly list which previous steps' outputs to include
  - Surgical context control
  - Balance between minimal and full

**Cleanup policies:**

- **`delete`** — Terminate session after step completes (recommended for production)
- **`keep`** — Leave session running for debugging

### Dashboard (#114)

Real-time monitoring for workflow execution.

**Summary cards:**

- Total workflows defined
- Active runs (currently executing)
- Completed runs (period-filtered: 24h/7d/30d)
- Failed runs (period-filtered)
- Average run duration
- Success rate (%)

**Active runs table:**

- Live-updating list of currently executing runs
- Workflow ID, status badge, started time, duration, current step, progress (step X/Y)
- Click to open WorkflowRunView
- Real-time updates via WebSocket
- Visual progress bars

**Recent runs history:**

- Last 50 workflow runs (filterable by status)
- Run ID, status badge, start time, duration, steps completed
- Click to open WorkflowRunView

**Workflow health metrics:**

- Per-workflow success rate
- Per-workflow average duration
- Run counts (total, completed, failed)
- Visual health indicators (green/yellow/red based on success rate)

### Real-Time Updates

**WebSocket-primary architecture:**

- All hooks now WebSocket-primary, polling is safety net only
- When connected: 120s polling intervals (safety net)
- When disconnected: aggressive polling resumes (10-30s)
- Events: `workflow:status` with full run state
- ~75% reduction in API calls when WebSocket connected

**Broadcast service:**

- Centralized `broadcastWorkflowStatus()` sends full run state
- No extra HTTP fetches needed
- Multiple clients can watch the same run (collaborative viewing)

### API Endpoints

### Security

- **ReDoS protection** — Regex patterns validated with size/complexity limits
- **Expression injection prevention** — Template evaluator only supports safe variable access and boolean operators
- **Parallel DoS limits** — Max 50 concurrent sub-steps
- **Gate approval validation** — Authentication and permission checks on approval endpoints
- **Path traversal protection** — `sanitizeFilename` on all file writes
- **RBAC** — Role-based access control with ACL files (`.acl.json`)
- **Audit logging** — All workflow changes logged to `.audit.jsonl`

### Performance

- **~75% reduction in API calls** when WebSocket connected
- **Progress file size cap** — 10MB limit prevents unbounded growth
- **Lazy-loaded frontend** — WorkflowsPage, WorkflowDashboard only render when navigated to
- **Memoized filters** — `useMemo` for filtered workflows/runs
- **Skeleton loading states** — Shimmer placeholders during data fetch

### Known Limitations

1. **OpenClaw integration placeholder** — Step executors have integration points for OpenClaw sessions API but don't yet call `sessions_spawn` (tracked in #110, #111)
2. **Loop verify step not wired** — `loop.verify_step` is parsed but not executed by workflow engine (tracked for Phase 5)
3. **No schema validation** — Step outputs are not validated against JSON Schema (planned for Phase 5)
4. **Parallel timeouts not enforced** — Parallel steps don't have a global timeout, only sub-step timeouts (planned for Phase 5)

- **Label mapping** — GitHub labels map to task fields: `priority:high` → priority, `type:story` → type
- **Circuit breaker** — Automatic failure detection and backoff for GitHub API calls
- **Polling** — Configurable polling interval for checking new/updated issues
- **Configuration** — Stored in `.veritas-kanban/integrations.json`; sync state in `.veritas-kanban/github-sync.json`
- **`TaskGitHub` interface** — Shared type with `{issueNumber, repo, syncedAt?}` fields on synced tasks
- **API endpoints:**
  - `POST /api/github/sync` — Trigger manual sync

## Activity Feed

Streamlined activity page focused on status history with real-time updates.

### Activity Page (v1.6.0)

- **Full-width status history** — Redesigned layout removes activity feed column, status history spans full width
- **Clickable task navigation** — Click any status history entry to open the task detail panel
- **Color-coded status badges:**
  - Agent statuses: `working`/`thinking` (green), `sub-agent` (purple), `idle` (gray), `error` (red)
  - Task statuses: `todo` (slate), `in-progress` (amber), `blocked` (red), `done` (blue)
- **Task title colors** — Title text colored to match the new status
- **Unified timeline** — Shows both agent status changes AND task status changes
- **Daily summary panel** — Retained above status history with utilization metrics

## CLI

The `vk` command-line tool for terminal-first workflows. Manage your entire task lifecycle from the terminal.

> 📖 **Full CLI guide:** [CLI-GUIDE.md](CLI-GUIDE.md) — installation, every command, scripting examples, and tips.

### Workflow Commands

Composite commands that orchestrate multiple API calls into a single action. Added in v1.4 (#44).

| Command                  | Description                                                        |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `vk begin <id>`          | Sets in-progress + starts timer + updates agent status to working  |
| `vk done <id> "summary"` | Stops timer + sets done + adds comment + sets agent status to idle |
| `vk block <id> "reason"` | Sets blocked + adds comment with the block reason                  |
| `vk unblock <id>`        | Sets in-progress + restarts timer                                  |

**Under the hood**, `vk begin` orchestrates three API calls (PATCH status, POST time/start, POST agent/status) and `vk done` orchestrates four (POST time/stop, PATCH status, POST comments, POST agent/status). What previously required 6+ curl commands now takes 2.

### Task Commands

| Command             | Alias | Description                                                        |
| ------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `vk list`           | `ls`  | List tasks with optional `--status`, `--type`, `--project` filters |
| `vk show <id>`      |       | Show task details (supports partial ID matching)                   |
| `vk create <title>` |       | Create a new task with `--type`, `--priority`, `--project` options |
| `vk update <id>`    |       | Update task fields (`--status`, `--title`, `--priority`, etc.)     |

### Time Tracking Commands

Full time management from the terminal. Added in v1.4 (#44).

| Command                                      | Description                                                    |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `vk time start <id>`                         | Start the time tracker for a task                              |
| `vk time stop <id>`                          | Stop the time tracker                                          |
| `vk time entry <id> <seconds> "description"` | Add a manual time entry (duration in seconds)                  |
| `vk time show <id>`                          | Display time tracking summary (total, running status, entries) |

### Comment Commands

Add comments to tasks from the terminal. Added in v1.4 (#44).

| Command                               | Description                                    |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `vk comment <id> "text"`              | Add a comment to a task                        |
| `vk comment <id> "text" --author Bot` | Add a comment with a custom author attribution |

### Agent Status Commands

Manage the global agent status indicator from the terminal. Added in v1.4 (#44).

| Command                      | Description                                             |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `vk agent status`            | Show current agent status (idle, working, sub-agent)    |

## Security

Defense-in-depth security model with multiple authentication methods and hardened defaults.

![Security menu](../assets/scr-menu_security.png)

### Authentication

- **JWT authentication** — Password-based user login with JWT session tokens
- **JWT secret rotation** — Secrets can be rotated; previous secrets remain valid during a grace period for seamless session continuity
- **Environment-based JWT secret** — `VERITAS_JWT_SECRET` env var overrides on-disk storage (never written to security.json)
- **Admin key** — Full-access API key via `VERITAS_ADMIN_KEY` (minimum 32 characters enforced)
- **Named API keys** — Multiple API keys with role assignment via `VERITAS_API_KEYS` (format: `name:key:role`)
- **Role-based access control** — Three roles: `admin` (full access), `agent` (read/write tasks and agents), `read-only` (GET only)
- **Localhost bypass** — Configurable unauthenticated localhost access with role assignment (`VERITAS_AUTH_LOCALHOST_ROLE`)
- **Multiple auth methods** — `Authorization: Bearer`, `X-API-Key` header, or `?api_key=` query param (for WebSocket)
- **Weak key detection** — Startup warnings for known weak defaults or keys under 32 characters
- **Password strength indicator** — Visual strength meter in the Security settings tab (weak/fair/good/strong/very strong)
- **Password change** — Change password from the Security settings tab with current password verification

### Network & Headers

- **CSP headers** — Content Security Policy via [Helmet](https://helmetjs.github.io/) with nonce-based script allowlisting
- **CSP nonce middleware** — Per-request nonce generation for inline scripts
- **Rate limiting** — 300 requests/minute per IP (configurable via `RATE_LIMIT_MAX`); sensitive endpoints (auth, settings) limited to 15/min; localhost exempt
- **CORS origin validation** — Configurable allowed origins via `CORS_ORIGINS` env var
- **WebSocket origin validation** — Origin checking on WebSocket upgrade requests

### Data Protection

- **MIME type validation** — Server-side file type validation for uploads via [multer](https://github.com/expressjs/multer)
- **Markdown sanitization** — XSS prevention via `sanitizeText()` on all user-generated content
- **Timing-safe comparison** — Credential comparison uses `crypto.timingSafeEqual` to prevent timing attacks
- **Credential redaction** — Sensitive fields stripped from task data in API responses
- **Path traversal protection** — Input validation to prevent directory traversal in file operations
- **Prototype pollution protection** — Settings validation prevents `__proto__` and constructor injection
- **Zod schema validation** — All API inputs validated with [Zod](https://zod.dev/) schemas

---

## Performance

Optimizations spanning server, frontend, and data lifecycle.

### Server

- **In-memory task caching** — Tasks cached in memory with file-system watchers for invalidation
- **Config caching** — Configuration cached with write-through invalidation
- **Gzip compression** — Response compression via [compression](https://github.com/expressjs/compression) middleware
- **Pagination** — Archive and list endpoints support paginated responses
- **Summary mode** — Lightweight task summaries (fewer fields) for list views
- **WebSocket-aware polling** — Frontend reduces polling frequency when WebSocket is connected
- **Telemetry retention** — Configurable retention period (default: 30 days) with automatic cleanup of old events
- **Telemetry compression** — NDJSON event files gzip-compressed after configurable threshold (default: 7 days)
- **Cache-control headers** — `Last-Modified` and conditional response support

### Frontend

- **Lazy-loaded dashboard** — Dashboard with recharts + d3 (~800KB) split into a separate chunk, loaded on demand
- **Vendor chunk splitting** — 69% bundle size reduction via Vite code splitting
- **Lazy-loaded settings tabs** — Each of the 8 settings tabs loaded on demand with skeleton placeholders
- **Memoized task cards** — Custom `React.memo` comparison function avoids unnecessary re-renders from React Query refetches
- **Debounced saves** — Task edits debounced to reduce API calls
- **Loading skeletons** — Board, settings tabs, and dashboard show shimmer placeholders during load

| Endpoint                      | Description                                                         |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET /api/analytics/timeline` | Task execution timeline with parallelism snapshots                  |
| `GET /api/analytics/metrics`  | Aggregate metrics (parallelism, throughput, lead time, utilization) |

**Timeline endpoint returns:**

- Start/end times from time tracking
- Task assignments and status history
- Parallelism snapshots (concurrent tasks over time)

**Metrics endpoint returns:**

- Parallelism factor (average concurrent tasks)
- Throughput (tasks completed per period)
- Lead time (creation to completion)
- Agent utilization (working time per agent)
- Efficiency metrics (tracked vs total time)

### Core Features

- **Task status overview** — Counts for each column with color-coded metric cards
- **Trend indicators** — Up/down/flat trends with percentage change compared to previous period
- **Blocked task breakdown** — Blocked task counts by category (feedback, technical snag, prerequisite, other)
- **Sprint velocity** — Track task completion rate over time
- **Cost budget tracking** — Token usage and cost metrics with budget cards
- **Agent comparison** — Side-by-side performance metrics across different AI agents (uses `apiFetch()` to properly unwrap the API envelope)
- **Drill-down panels** — Click any metric card to drill into tasks, errors, tokens, or duration details; focus rings use `ring-inset` to prevent clipping
  - **Tasks drill-down** — List of tasks matching the selected metric; clicking a task opens its detail panel (with API fallback for deleted tasks via `open-task` event)
  - **Errors drill-down** — Failed agent runs with error details
  - **Tokens drill-down** — Token usage breakdown by agent and task
  - **Duration drill-down** — Time distribution analysis
- **Trends charts** — Time-series charts for key metrics; rolling average line in vibrant cyan-teal for contrast with the purple theme; bar chart hover uses subtle muted fill instead of white flash
- **Status timeline** — Daily Activity (75%) + Recent Status Changes (25%) side-by-side layout
- **Section collapsing** — Dashboard sections apply `overflow-hidden` only when collapsed
- **Daily digest** — Summary of the day's activity: tasks completed/created, agent runs, token usage, failures and issues
- **Task-level metrics** — Per-task panel showing attempt history, token counts, duration, cost, and status timeline

### Architecture

- **Lazy-loaded tabs** — Each tab loaded on demand with Suspense fallback skeletons
- **Error boundaries per tab** — Crash in one tab doesn't take down the dialog; recovery button to retry
- **Debounced auto-save** — Settings changes saved automatically with visual save indicator
- **Import/Export** — Backup all settings to JSON; restore with validation
- **Reset to defaults** — Per-section reset with confirmation
- **Managed list manager** — Reusable sortable list component with drag-and-drop reordering (used for projects, sprints, task types)

---

## API

RESTful API designed for both human and AI agent consumption.

### Versioning

- **Versioned paths** — `/api/v1/tasks` (canonical) and `/api/tasks` (backwards-compatible alias)
- **Version header** — Every response includes `X-API-Version: v1`
- **Client version request** — Clients may send `X-API-Version` header
- **Deprecation policy** — Breaking changes introduce a new version; previous version remains available during deprecation

### Authentication Methods

1. `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header (JWT or API key)
2. `X-API-Key: <key>` header
3. `?api_key=<key>` query parameter (for WebSocket connections)

### Real-Time Updates

- **WebSocket server** — Real-time task change broadcasts on `ws://localhost:3001`
- **WebSocket connection indicator** — UI shows connected/disconnected status

  ![WebSocket activity](../assets/scr-menu_websocket_activity.png)

- **Agent output streaming** — Live agent output over WebSocket
- **Broadcast service** — Centralized WebSocket message dispatch for task changes

### Response Format

All responses use a standardized envelope format:

**Success:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { ... },
  "meta": {
    "timestamp": "2026-02-01T00:00:00.000Z",
    "requestId": "uuid-v4",
    "timezone": "UTC-06:00",
    "utcOffset": -6
  }
}
```

**Error:**

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "NOT_FOUND",
    "message": "Task not found",
    "details": { ... }
  },
  "meta": {
    "timestamp": "2026-02-01T00:00:00.000Z",
    "requestId": "uuid-v4"
  }
}
```

**Pagination** (on paginated endpoints via `sendPaginated` helper):

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [ ... ],
  "meta": {
    "timestamp": "...",
    "requestId": "...",
    "page": 1,
    "limit": 25,
    "total": 142,
    "totalPages": 6
  }
}
```

- 4 typed error classes: `UnauthorizedError`, `ForbiddenError`, `BadRequestError`, `InternalError`
- `X-API-Version` header on all responses
- `X-Request-Id` header for request tracing
- `Last-Modified` headers for cache validation

---

## Notifications

Event-driven notifications with Teams integration.

- **Microsoft Teams integration** — Notifications formatted for Teams delivery with type-specific emoji icons
- **Notification types** — Agent complete (✅), agent failed (❌), needs review (👀), task done (🎉), high priority (🔴), error (⚠️), milestone (🏆), info (ℹ️)
- **Pending notifications queue** — Unsent notifications queued for batch delivery
- **Mark-sent tracking** — Track which notifications have been delivered
- **Auto-detection** — `notify:check` scans for tasks needing notification (review-ready, agent failures, etc.)
- **Per-event toggles** — Enable/disable notifications per event type in the Notifications settings tab
- **Notification enrichment** — Task title and project automatically attached when task ID provided

---

## Storage & Architecture

Abstract storage layer that decouples business logic from the filesystem.

- **Repository pattern** — 5 repository interfaces abstract data access: `ActivityRepository`, `TemplateRepository`, `StatusHistoryRepository`, `ManagedListRepository`, `TelemetryRepository`
- **StorageProvider** — Central provider extended with all repository implementations; services depend on interfaces, not filesystem calls
- **`fs-helpers.ts`** — Centralized filesystem access module; the only file in the codebase that imports `fs` directly
- **Service migration** — All 10 services migrated off direct `fs` imports to use the repository interfaces
- **Extensibility** — Repository interfaces enable future storage backends (database, cloud storage) without changing service logic

---

## Infrastructure & DevOps

Production-ready deployment and development tooling.

### Docker

- **Multi-stage build** — 5-stage Dockerfile (deps → build-shared → build-web → build-server → production)
- **Non-root execution** — Production image runs as non-root user
- **Alpine-based** — Minimal `node:22-alpine` base image
- **Layer caching** — Workspace config and lockfile copied first for optimal Docker layer caching
- **Frozen lockfile** — `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` for reproducible builds

### CI/CD

- **GitHub Actions** — CI pipeline on push to `main` and pull requests
- **Concurrency control** — In-progress runs cancelled when new commits push
- **Pipeline jobs** — Lint & type check, server unit tests, E2E tests (3 parallel jobs)
- **pnpm caching** — Dependency cache for faster CI runs

### Development

- **Pre-commit hooks** — [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) triggers lint-staged on commit
- **lint-staged** — Runs ESLint on staged files
- **Gitleaks** — Pre-commit secret scanning via [gitleaks](https://gitleaks.io/) (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`)
- **Concurrent dev servers** — `pnpm dev` starts both web and API servers simultaneously
- **ESLint** — Linting across all packages
- **TypeScript strict mode** — Full strict checking across the monorepo

### Observability

- **Structured logging** — [Pino](https://getpino.io/) for JSON-structured server logs with pretty-printing in development
- **Request ID middleware** — Unique ID assigned to every request for distributed tracing
- **Request traces** — Full request trace service for debugging
- **Graceful shutdown** — Clean service disposal on SIGTERM/SIGINT
- **Unhandled error handlers** — Catches unhandled rejections and exceptions at the process level

---

## Testing

Multi-layer testing strategy.

### Unit Tests (Vitest)

- **61 test files** · **1,143 tests passing** across server and frontend
- **Server (51 files, 1,033 tests):**
  - All middleware (auth, rate limiting, request ID, API versioning, cache control, validation, response envelope, request timeout)
  - Core services (task, template, telemetry, notification, activity, sprint, diff, conflict, summary, status history, digest, attachment, text extraction, migration, managed list, broadcast, automation, blocking, failure alert, metrics, settings, JWT rotation, MIME validation, preview, trace, circuit breaker)
  - Route handlers (tasks, task archive, task comments, task subtasks, task time, auth, agent status, automation, config, notifications, templates, health, misc routes)
  - Schema validation (common, task mutation, auth, config, telemetry, metrics, time, archive, agent, feature settings, conflict, diff, preview)
  - WebSocket origin validation
  - Prometheus metrics (counters, gauges, histograms, registry, collector middleware)
  - Environment variable validation
- **Frontend (10 files, 110 tests):**
  - API client helpers and task operations
  - Custom hooks: useWebSocket, useKeyboard (keyboard shortcuts)
  - Components: KanbanBoard, TaskCard, ErrorBoundary, AgentStatusIndicator, WebSocketIndicator
  - Shared test utilities with mock factories and providers
  - HTML/XSS sanitization (sanitizeHtml, sanitizeText)

### End-to-End Tests (Playwright)

- **7 spec files** covering critical user flows
- **19/19 tests passing**
- **Test suites:**
  - Health check
  - Settings management
  - Task creation
  - Task detail panel
  - Task list/board
  - Task status transitions
- **Helpers module** for shared test utilities

## Accessibility

Working toward WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.

- **ARIA labels** — Applied to interactive elements: buttons, dialogs, form controls, navigation
- **Keyboard navigation** — Full keyboard support: j/k navigation, Enter to open, Esc to close, number keys for column moves
- **Keyboard shortcuts dialog** — Discoverable via `?` key with grouped shortcut reference

  ![Keyboard shortcuts](../assets/scr-menu_keyboard.png)

- **Focus management** — Focus trapped in dialogs and sheets; restored on close
- **Screen reader support** — Semantic HTML, ARIA roles, and descriptive labels throughout
- **Color contrast** — Dark and light mode palettes designed for readability; purple primary (`270° 50% 40%`) buttons with white text in dark mode
- **Skip navigation** — Keyboard users can navigate efficiently between sections
- **Sortable list accessibility** — Drag-and-drop lists in settings include keyboard-accessible reordering
- **Interactive cards** — Task cards, metric cards, and stat cards support keyboard activation (Enter/Space)
- **Error boundaries** — Crash recovery UI accessible via keyboard
